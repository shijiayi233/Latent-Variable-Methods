## Problem 1

a. 0.56 is the correlations between improvement in Negative Symptoms (SANS Ratings) and positive symptoms for patients given Olanzapine, Haloperidol, or Placebo.
0.31 is the correlations between improvement in Negative Symptoms (SANS Ratings) and depressive symptoms for patients given Olanzapine, Haloperidol, or Placebo.
0.13 is the correlations between improvement in Negative Symptoms (SANS Ratings) and extrapyramidal symptoms for patients given Olanzapine, Haloperidol, or Placebo.

linear regression. P, D, E represent change in positive, depressive, and extrapyramidal symptoms respectively. In figure 2, X represents high-dose olanzapine versus placebo and Y represents total differential treatment effect on negative symptoms. In figure 4, X represents high-dose olanzapine versus haloperidol and Y represents total differential treatment effect on negative symptoms. 

c. The treatment effect denotes the additional change in scores of olanzapine-treated subjects relative to that of subjects who received either placebo or haloperidol. The \textbf{total treatment effect} on negative
symptoms is the sum of both the direct effect and the indirect effects.

For high-dose versus placebo:   
total effect: $1.52+1.91+0.17-0.10=3.5$;   
direct effect: $1.91/3.5*100\%=55\%$  
indirect effect through positive symptoms: $1.52/3.5*100%=43%$  
indirect effect through depressive symptoms: $0.17/3.5*100%=5%$  
indirect effect through extrapyramidal symptoms: $-0.1/3.5*100%=-3%$   

For high-dose olanzapine versus haloperidol:  
total effect: $0.05+1.92+0.02+0.29=2.28$;  
direct effect: $1.92/2.28*100\%=84\%$  
indirect effect through positive symptoms: $0.05/2.28*100%=2%$  
indirect effect through depressive symptoms: $0.02/2.28*100%=1%$  
indirect effect through extrapyramidal symptoms: $0.29/2.28*100%=13%$   

d. Compared to placebo, the high-dose olanzapine makes positive symptoms lower by 2.98 points in BPRS positive symptom subscale score, makes depressive symptoms lower by 0.49 points in BPRS item 9 (depressive mood) score, and makes extrapyramidal symptoms higher by 0.25 points in SimpsonAngus scale total score.

d. Similarity: Both models test causal effect of BMI and unhealthy weight control behaviors as well as causal effect of tease tendency and unhealthy weight control behaviors, viewing body satisfaction as a mediator. 
Difference: Model in b considers latent variable. It considers tendency to tease of both friends and family, and consider diet and other specific behaviors as a whole. Model in c only considers tendency of friends to tease participants about their weights, and considers two outcomes separately.
